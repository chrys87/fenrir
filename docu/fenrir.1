.SH Fenrir User Manual
.PP
Fenrir is a modern command line screen reader written in Python3.
.PP
It has a modular structure, a flexible based driver model, is highly
configurable and easy to customize and extend (see Developer
Manual (fenrir_development_manual)).
.PP
Please see the following pages for the current (fenrir_current_version)
and Git (fenrir_git_version) version of Fenrir.
.SH Support and Requirements
.PP
Fenrir requires several drivers to interact with the operating system.
.SS Speech Drivers
.PP
A speech driver is for communication with the text to speech system like
Speech\-Dispatcher (#SpeechDispatcher) or
Espeak (http://espeak.sourceforge.net).
\\ See section Speech (#Speech) in \[aq]\[aq]settings.conf\[aq]\[aq] for
more information.
.SS SpeechDispatcher
.PP
This driver is used by default.
It uses Speech\-dispatcher as its backend.
.PP
Dependencies:
.IP \[bu] 2
Speech\-dispatcher (installed and configured,
Documentation (https///devel.freebsoft.org/speechd#sec2))
.IP \[bu] 2
Python\-speechd
.SS Espeak
.PP
Uses Espeak via Python bindings.
.PP
Dependencies:
.IP \[bu] 2
Espeak or Espeak\-ng
.IP \[bu] 2
python\-espeak (https///launchpad.net/python-espeak)
.SS Generic
.PP
This invokes speech via a sub\-process.
This is almost the same as using the commandline.
The performance depends on the overhead of the speech synthesis
application but it is really flexible.
.PP
Dependencies:
.IP \[bu] 2
Espeak or Espeak\-ng
.PP
The Requirements are flexible, they depend on the configuration in
settings.conf.
.SS Dummy

.SS Screen Drivers
.PP
The job of a screen driver is to get the information of current screen
content.\\ See section Screen (#Screen) in
\[aq]\[aq]settings.conf\[aq]\[aq] for more information.
.SS VCSA
.PP
This driver is used by default.
For Linux VCSA devices.
These exist on any current standard installation of Linux.
.PP

## Currently supported platforms
.PP
Currently Fenrir completely supports the following Platforms:
.IP \[bu] 2
Linux TTY Support for further Systems are planned.
.SH Installation
.PP
Fenrir can run without installation.
It just requires the dependencies are installed first.
.PP
We recommend to try it out before installation to be sure everything
works and prevent yourself from experiencing a non\-talking environment.
.SS Try Out
.PP
Fenrir does not require installation.
You can try it and make sure everything works before you decide to
install.
In this way you can be sure that your system doesnt break or stop
talking.
for that you can just grab the code and run as root
\[aq]\[aq]src/fenrir/fenrir\[aq]\[aq] (in foreground) or
\[aq]\[aq]src/fenrir/fenrir\-daemon\[aq]\[aq] (in background, used by
systemd for autostart)

See section Braille (#Braille) in \[aq]\[aq]settings.conf\[aq]\[aq] for
more information.
### braille flush

If a message appears on the Braille device you can flush it to get back
to the review\- or system cursor ### Braille pan left

If a line is longer than your Braille devices you can move the view
(called panning) to the left.
So you can read stuff without the need to move the review\- or system
cursor.
### Braille pan right

(called panning) to the right.

### braille return to cursor

panning, the focus can be returned to the current used cursor by using
"return to cursor" command.
## Dictionary
.PP
You can make use of different kinds of built\-in dictionary\[aq]s.
A dictionary has a name and list of keys and values separated by :===:
Example: [customDict] Chrys:===:Chrys is cool lollipop:===:lolli that
means that every instance "chrys" is displayed, speech will say Chrys is
cool.
"lollipop" is spoken as "lolli".
Before making changes to a dictionary we recommend making a backup of
your current dictionary in case future updates overwrite your local
changes.
### Punctuation
.SS Level
.PP
The punctuation level dict contains lists with "what punctuation is
spoken in what level".
the default one looks like this: [levelDict] none:===:
some:===:.\-$~+*\-/\\\@  most:===:.,:\-$~+*\-/\@!#%^&\f[I]()[]}{\f[C]<>\f[];
all:===:!"#$%& \[aq]()\f[]+,\-./:;\f[C]<=>\f[]?\@[\\]^_`{|}~ the level
"none" has no values.
so it should not speak any punctuation (sadly this is not respected by
every TTS system) if "some" is the current level the following are
spoken: dot dash dollar tilde plus star slash backslash at.
same for most and all, you can add new levels.
if you cycle punctuation levels they are recognized.
the default punctuation level is set in settings.conf.
The default is "some".
#### Punctuation
.PP
The punctuation dictionary "[punctDict]" contains how the punctuation is
spoken.
Example: [punctDict] \f[I]:===:line
.PD 0
.P
.PD
speaks an \f[] as "line".
.PD 0
.P
.PD
[punctDict] \f[I]:===:underscore speaks an \f[] as underscore.
for question mark an ?
is appended to the word that the TTS system can announce the question
correctly.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
### Custom
.PP
The dict "[customDict]" is just for your own use, it just replace the
key with the value without any special functionality.
This might be used to fix incorrectly spoken words, make words more
common, shorter or just for fun.
:) ### Emoticons
.PP
The Emoticons dictionary "[emoticonDict]" by default contains some
emoticons.
it can replace ":)" with "smile" or "XD" with "loool" Making chat more
colorful.
A nice feature with this dictionary is that you can toggle the
substitution on or off during run time or in settings.conf.
This is useful because while doing programming or other serious work you
want to hear colons and perryns not smiles.
# Configuration
.PP
You can configure Fenrir in the following places (ordered by priority):
1.
Commandline Parameters \[aq]\[aq]\-o\[aq]\[aq] see Set settings
coption (#Set settings coption) 2.
/etc/fenrir/settings/settings.conf see Settigns (#Settings) 3.

hard coded defaults ## Commandline Arguments
.SS Set settings option
.PP
You can specify options that overwrite the setting.conf.
This is done with \[aq]\[aq]\-o \f[C]<list\ of\ options>\f[] parameter.
The list of options have the following syntax fenrir \-o
"section#setting=value;section#setting=value"
.PP
For example changing the sound driver to gstreamer and disabling Braille

Customization
.SS Scripting
.PP
Scripts can be in any language, bash, python, sh or others.
Place your scripts in the directory /usr/share/fenrirscreenreader/scripts/ (the path
is configurable in settings.conf).
The script key is the applications key.
Usually this key can be found on the keyboard located just left of the
right most control key.
When you name a script, the key name appears in the script seperated by
the sequence \f[B]\-\f[].
So, for example, if you have a python weather script you want assigned
to the script key plus the letter w you would name the script
/usr/share/fenrirscreenreader/scripts/weather__\-__key_w.py Then, to access the
script, simply press the script key and the letter w.
Scripts must be executable.
So, make sure to chmod 755 your script when you place it in the scripts
directory.
The script gets some parameters from fenrir when it is executed.
So that information is available in your script then.

.SS Commands
.PP
You can place your own commands in "/usr/share/fenrirscreenreader/commands" (path is

Commands are python files with a special scheme.
You can assign them to a shortcut using the filename without an
extension or place them in a hook trigger like OnInput or
OnScreenChange.
For further information see developer guide.
Good Examples:
"date.py" (https///github.com/chrys87/fenrir/blob/master/src/fenrir/commands/commands/date.py)
(announce the Date),
"shut_up.py" (https///github.com/chrys87/fenrir/blob/master/src/fenrir/commands/commands/shut_up.py)
