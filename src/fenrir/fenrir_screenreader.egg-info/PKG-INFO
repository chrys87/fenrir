Description: # Fenrir
        A TTY screenreader for Linux.
        In theory it's not just limited to Linux. but i currently only provide drivers for that since I do not have another system here. If you want to help, or write drivers to make it work on other systems, just let me know.

        # installation
        - Archlinux: PKGBUILD in AUR
        - Manual: run install.sh and uninstall.sh as root
        - you also can just run it from Git without installing:
        You can just run the following as root:
        if you are in Fenrir Git rootfolder:
        cd src/fenrir/
        sudo ./fenrir
        Settings "settings.conf" is located in the "config" directory or after installation in /etc/fenrir/settings.
        Take care to use drivers from the config matching your installed drivers. 
        By default it uses:
        - sound driver: genericDriver (via sox, could configured in settings.conf)
        - speech driver: speechdDriver
        - braille driver: brlttyDriver (WIP)
        - input driver: evdevDriver
